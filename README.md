# Linux Automation Project

## Section 1: Introduction to Linux Automation

### Overview
In this section, we explore the power of Linux terminal commands for automation tasks. The project involves monitoring `sudo` command usage and sending email notifications when certain conditions are met. We set up a low-privileged user, configure email sending via Gmail, and test the email setup.

### Steps
1. **Create a Low-Privileged User**: Set up a new user in the Linux system for testing purposes.
2. **Install `mailutils`**: Install the necessary package to enable email sending from the terminal.
3. **Configure Postfix and Gmail**: Set up Postfix and create an app password in Gmail for secure email sending.
4. **Test Email Notifications**: Verify that the email configuration works by sending a test email from the terminal.

### Tools Used
- **Linux Terminal**: For executing commands and automating tasks.
- **Postfix**: For handling email sending.
- **Mailutils**: Utility package for sending emails via terminal.
